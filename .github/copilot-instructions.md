This is a pure Dart project designed to run various benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Dart code. Each test should prioritize both accuracy and fairness to ensure reliable and consistent performance measurements.
We use 'benchmark_harness' package for creating tests. Any benchmark file should be created at './test folder.
